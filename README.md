CAT808 Zarch
============

Messing around with 3D "Zarch/Virus" like landscape, a Javascript + Canvas 3D landscape based on Zarch/Virus

Needs lots of optimisation and code clean up :)

+ Running here: http://revdancatt.github.com/CAT808-zarch/

TODO
====

1. Render the actual ship
2. Adjust the speed to be a combination of thrust and angle
3. Add height
4. Add Shadow
5. Random landscape generation
6. Larger landscape
